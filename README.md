# DeepLearning

1) Created python script to deploy Sigmoid neuron from scratch - SigmoidNeuron.ipynb. Used the same to predict whether the user likes the mobile phone.

2) Text_Non_Text_Classification: Used SigmoidNeuron to to predict whether the image has text.

3) FeedForwardNetwork.ipynb: Created FeedForward network from scratch and used the to classify complex dataset available in scikit learn.

4) FFNetworksUsingPyTorch.ipynb: same as above but instead using PyTorch.


Note: To create these scripts a lot of learning is taken from 10-785 Intro to deep learning http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/
and PadhAI https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/ tought by IIT Madras Professors Mitesh Khapra and Pratyush Kumar.
