# DeepLearning

1) Created python script to deploy Sigmoid neuron from scratch - SigmoidNeuron.ipynb. Used the same to predict whether the user likes the mobile phone.

2) Text_Non_Text_Classification: Used SigmoidNeuron to to predict whether the image has text.

3) FeedForwardNetwork.ipynb: Created FeedForward network from scratch and used the to classify complex dataset available in scikit learn.

4) FFNetworksUsingPyTorch.ipynb: same as above but instead using PyTorch.

5) LargeCNNs.ipynb: Used different CNN architectures like Residual Net, VGG, Inception and densenet to classify CIFAR 10 dataset.
